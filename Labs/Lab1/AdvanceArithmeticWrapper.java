		 *
		 * HINT 2: Use an ArrayList to store the numbers, then pass them on to an int array, 
		 * similar to a vector in C++.
		 *
		 * HINT 3: Remember the difference between Object Data Types and Primitive Data Types

		 * of the previous 2 terms:
		 * 
		 * 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...
		 * 
		 * By definition, the fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
		 * 
		 * F_0 = 0
